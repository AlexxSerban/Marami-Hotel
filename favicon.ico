# Favicon.ico placeholder
# This file should be replaced with a real favicon.ico containing the letter M
# The favicon.svg file is already created and will be used by modern browsers
# To create a proper favicon.ico:
# 1. Use an online favicon generator
# 2. Create a 32x32 image with GREEN background (#2E7D5F) and white letter M
# 3. Convert to ICO format
# 4. Replace this file
